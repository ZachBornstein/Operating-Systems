User Interfaces: One of the primary purposes of an operating system is to provide a User Interface through which the user can recieve infromation from and give commands to a
device. The most common type of User Interfaces are graphic which create a visually appealing and easy to navigate experience through the use of visuals and icons that create a clear
distinction between the vairous tasks the device is performing with each having its own window. How a user interacts with a graphic user interface depends on the size and purpose of
the device being used. Smaller devices and tablets usually use a touchscreen on which the user will tap, swipe, and gesture to navigate the UI, and on laptops and desktops the user
will usually use a pointing device like a mouse as well as a keyboard to input text. The other less common type of user interface is command line. With a command line interface the 
user will direcly input commands for the device to execute in its precise command language.
